# Code refactoring techniques

## Overview
Code refactoring is the process of restructuring existing computer code without changing its external behavior. Its primary goal is to improve code's internal structure for better readability, maintainability, and extensibility. It's a continuous process for healthier, adaptable codebases.

## Key Concepts
*   **Extract Method:** Splitting large, complex methods into smaller, focused ones, improving readability and promoting the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP). *Example:* Turning a multi-step `processOrder()` into `validateOrder()`, `calculateTotal()`, and `saveOrder()`.
*   **Rename Variable/Method/Class:** Assigning clearer, descriptive names to elements for better comprehension. *Example:* Changing `x` to `customerAge` or `calc()` to `calculateDiscount()`.
*   **Introduce Parameter Object:** Grouping multiple related parameters into a single object, especially for methods with many arguments. *Example:* Replacing `createOrder(customerName, address, city, zip)` with `createOrder(customerDetails)`.
*   **Consolidate Conditional Expression:** Simplifying complex `if/else` statements into single, clearer conditions, reducing cognitive load. *Example:* Combining multiple conditions `if (a && b) || (c && d)` into a single, more readable expression.

## Practical Example
Imagine a long report generation function (fetching, processing, formatting). A practical **Extract Method** refactoring would involve:
*   Extracting `fetchReportData()` for data retrieval.
*   Extracting `processRawData(rawData)` for business logic.
*   Extracting `formatReport(processedData)` for output presentation.
This makes the main method concise, easier to understand, and each step independently testable.

## Key Takeaways
-   **Incremental Improvement:** Refactor in small, controlled steps, frequently committing.
-   **Test-Driven Refactoring:** Ensure robust tests are in place to prevent altering external behavior.
-   **Enhanced Quality:** Improves readability, maintainability, extensibility, and reduces technical debt.
-   **Continuous Practice:** It's an ongoing discipline, not a one-time project, crucial for long-term project health.

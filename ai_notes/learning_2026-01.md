# Code refactoring techniques

## Overview
Code refactoring is the process of restructuring existing computer code without changing its external behavior. Its primary goal is to improve code's internal structure for better readability, maintainability, and extensibility. It's a continuous process for healthier, adaptable codebases.

## Key Concepts
*   **Extract Method:** Splitting large, complex methods into smaller, focused ones, improving readability and promoting the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP). *Example:* Turning a multi-step `processOrder()` into `validateOrder()`, `calculateTotal()`, and `saveOrder()`.
*   **Rename Variable/Method/Class:** Assigning clearer, descriptive names to elements for better comprehension. *Example:* Changing `x` to `customerAge` or `calc()` to `calculateDiscount()`.
*   **Introduce Parameter Object:** Grouping multiple related parameters into a single object, especially for methods with many arguments. *Example:* Replacing `createOrder(customerName, address, city, zip)` with `createOrder(customerDetails)`.
*   **Consolidate Conditional Expression:** Simplifying complex `if/else` statements into single, clearer conditions, reducing cognitive load. *Example:* Combining multiple conditions `if (a && b) || (c && d)` into a single, more readable expression.

## Practical Example
Imagine a long report generation function (fetching, processing, formatting). A practical **Extract Method** refactoring would involve:
*   Extracting `fetchReportData()` for data retrieval.
*   Extracting `processRawData(rawData)` for business logic.
*   Extracting `formatReport(processedData)` for output presentation.
This makes the main method concise, easier to understand, and each step independently testable.

## Key Takeaways
-   **Incremental Improvement:** Refactor in small, controlled steps, frequently committing.
-   **Test-Driven Refactoring:** Ensure robust tests are in place to prevent altering external behavior.
-   **Enhanced Quality:** Improves readability, maintainability, extensibility, and reduces technical debt.
-   **Continuous Practice:** It's an ongoing discipline, not a one-time project, crucial for long-term project health.

# Design patterns in Python

## Overview
Design patterns are reusable solutions to common software design problems. While language-agnostic in concept, their implementation varies. In Python, patterns leverage dynamic typing and built-in features to offer elegant, maintainable, and scalable code structures, enhancing collaboration and reducing technical debt by providing a shared vocabulary for developers.

## Key Concepts
Python's flexibility allows patterns to be implemented often more concisely than in stricter languages. They improve code organization, reusability, and testability. Categories include Creational (e.g., Factory Method, Singleton for object creation), Structural (e.g., Adapter, Decorator for composing classes/objects), and Behavioral (e.g., Observer, Strategy for object interaction and responsibility).

## Practical Example
Consider the **Singleton pattern**, ensuring a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it. This is useful for logging, configuration managers, or resource-heavy objects.

```python
class Logger:
    _instance = None

    def __new__(cls):
        if cls._instance is None:
            cls._instance = super().__new__(cls)
        return cls._instance

    def log(self, message):
        print(f"LOG: {message}")

# Usage
logger1 = Logger()
logger2 = Logger()
logger1.log("This is the first message.")
logger2.log("This is the second message.")
print(f"Are logger1 and logger2 the same instance? {logger1 is logger2}")
```

## Key Takeaways
- **Solve Common Problems:** They provide tested solutions to recurring design challenges, saving development time.
- **Improve Code Quality:** Lead to more organized, flexible, and maintainable codebases by promoting best practices.
- **Shared Vocabulary:** Establish a common understanding among developers, simplifying communication about system design.

# Design patterns in Python

## Overview
Design patterns are reusable solutions to common software design problems, offering proven blueprints for building robust, maintainable, and scalable code. While Python's dynamic nature often allows for simpler, more idiomatic solutions, understanding classic patterns helps structure complex applications, improves communication among developers, and leverages best practices. They guide developers in creating flexible and extensible systems that are easier to understand and evolve.

## Key Concepts
Patterns are broadly categorized into **Creational** (object creation mechanisms, e.g., Factory Method, Singleton), **Structural** (composing classes and objects, e.g., Adapter, Decorator), and **Behavioral** (managing object interactions and responsibilities, e.g., Observer, Strategy). Python's features, like higher-order functions and decorators, provide elegant ways to implement many behavioral and structural patterns. For example, a Python module can implicitly serve as a Singleton by virtue of how modules are loaded.

## Practical Example
The **Decorator** pattern adds new functionality to an object or function without altering its core structure. Python provides built-in syntax (`@decorator`) for this, making it highly accessible:

```python
def log_execution(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        print(f"Executing '{func.__name__}' with args: {args}")
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        return result
    return wrapper

@log_execution
def greet(name):
    """Returns a greeting for the given name."""
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

# Usage: greet("Alice") will print an execution message then return "Hello, Alice!"
```

## Key Takeaways
- **Problem-Solving Framework**: Patterns offer tested solutions, saving development time and reducing errors for common design challenges.
- **Improved Communication**: Provide a common vocabulary for discussing and documenting design choices within a team.
- **Pythonic Adaptation**: Prioritize Python's idiomatic features (e.g., built-in decorators, context managers) over rigid adherence to classical patterns when a simpler solution exists.
- **Don't Over-Engineer**: Apply patterns judiciously, only when they genuinely solve a recurring problem or significantly improve a system's flexibility and maintainability.
